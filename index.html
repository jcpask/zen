        <p>I learned a lot so far in this course.  One thing I can sum up is this.  I can use HTML to structure information into a boring webpage.  However, I can use CSS to take that boring webpage and make it <i>truly</i> ugly.  Yes, CSS has empowered me to make webpages with the most hideous combinations of colors and boxes that I've ever seen.  Also, every student's webpage I've seen in this class is grotesque too, so it's not just me.  </p>
        
        <p>This brings me to Zen Garden.  My favorite part of it is swapping the designs (including mid-century modern) via CSS, while keeping the content similar.  I'm sure that's everyone's favorite part.  It makes it seem like there's lots of potential.  </p>
